Sketch 1

With this piece I wanted to convey a feeling of walking indoors when it's really cold outside. 
The circle in the middle depicts breathing, especially a calm one. The yellow shows a feeling of warmth that one gets being indoors on a cold and windy day. 
T
he background changes colors from white-ish to black-ish. Those are just colors I 
personally associate with winter. White because of snow and black because the nights are
longer.
