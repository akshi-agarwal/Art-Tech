"Wait, go Incognito first‚Äù


Inspiration: 
I wanted to do an art piece on internet privacy . I have an Echo dot and I am very often told that it is tracking everything I do. 
So, for this piece I decided to make an eye that is aware of our movements and is constantly looking.

Process: 
Initially, I wanted the piece to have more of a serious feel. Maybe, it could talk about how we seek obscurity at times. 
However, it wasn't really me. So instead I decided to take a light hearted and straightforward approach to it. 

From a technical point of view: 
I thought of having a picture of the matrix in the background. So I learnt how to do that.
 I struggled a little bit with moving the eyeball. My pushMatrix and popMatrix were failing but I reviewed the lecture material. I tried to understand how they were implemented and eventually I was able to fix my problem. 
Another thing I used was the delay function. 


Piece: 
With this piece I was trying to capture a general feeling of lack of privacy that internet users have these days. I want them to feel that they are being looked at constantly, especially when they see the eye. 


Colors and Movement: 
The matrix is stereotypically green and hence I made the eyeball green too. This gives the piece uniformity.
As for the movement, the piece directs the attention towards the center.  Ideally, the viewer should track the movement of the eyeball.
